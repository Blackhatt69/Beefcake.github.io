##  Pokétwo Autocatcher 
A **free** and open-source Pokétwo Autocatcher / Spammer, created with the goal of preventing people from wasting their money AND it actually works.

---

### Features
The bot has the following features:
- Easy Setup (simply run a script and enter the correct information, no 'coding' needed)
- Auto-levelling (Level up all your duel Pokémon to level 100 **overnight**!)
- Get notified when and if you've caught a Pokémon, and also if another event occurs
- See when a Shiny/Legendary/Ultra Beast/Mythical Pokémon is caught, and which one it is!
- **Completely free/Trustworthy** and open-source (you can see the code as it is)
- Support for all Pokémon from generation I to generation VIII, including all Alolan and Galarian Pokémon
- The autocatcher can even handle Incense!
- Pokétwo-Resistant - the autocatcher sends a random series of numbers to enhance undetectability

### Getting Started:
To start up the bot on replit, go to the 'Secrets' tab on replit (the lock icon) and in the 'key' area, write `user_token`, and then type in your discord account token in the 'value' section. <br>

Then, create another secret with `spam_id` in the 'key' section, and type in the channel id you want the bot to spam in into the 'value' section. <br>

Then, create another secret with `catch_id` in the 'key' section, and type in the channel id you want the bot to catch in into the 'value' section. <br>

Then, create another secret with `user_id` in the 'key' section, and type in the user id into the 'value' section. <br> 

**If you do not want to use the autocatcher, you can put the `catch_id` value the same as the `spam_id`value and it will not catch anything, only spam.**

### Running
Once you have installed the correct dependencies, click the green 'Run' icon at the top of your webpage. If a new window opens up with 'Bot logged on' written inside, and `Logged into account: <account name>` has appeared into your console, then the bot has successfully started.

### How to keep it running
make an account on https://uptimerobot.com create a https monitor, paste the url that appears on the right after you run the bot and save

---


### Auto-levelling
To enable auto-levelling, just put in the ID's of the Pokémon you want to be levelled up into the `level` file (inside the `data` folder).

## Spamming
This Autocatcher sends a message every 3 seconds as it is Discords miniumum so you dont get banned / suspended. 100% completely undetected if set up properly.

---

## Catching 
This Autocatcher pings Poketwo when catching, does not use the servers prefix. 
It will catch 3 seconds after a pokemon has spawned. Sierra bot is not need although helpful. 

## **DISCLAIMER**

Please note that self botting is against Discord's Terms of Service and being discovered using a self bot may result in your account being banned. To avoid this, keep knowledge of your self bot to a minimum and use a throwaway account. I am not responsible for any accounts lost due to this self bot. I also recommend checking the self bot channel's messages occasionally to see if Pokétwo has sent a captcha. **If it has, it would be a good idea to solve it, to continue catching.**
